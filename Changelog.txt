20180820 - You can leave goal specs empty if you specify which tool to use.

20180818 - Added optional "workflow must include this tool"-field.

20180823 - "audio/wav" content type for files ending with ".wav"

20180821 - Clean up java code, added links to the input, the intermediary files
           and the output to the poll window.

20180815 - Clip xml declaration from spangrp file before embedding it in text
           element in TEI file.

20180813 - Improved unfoldTreeN$ to discard solutions that imply incompatible
           assumptions about input feature values. (Not all input features are
           necessarily fixed when workflows are computed.) Computation is
           generally faster and the results are cleaner.

20180810 - Pruned workflows with a tool that has multiple inputs that differ
           in more than one feature. (Features of inputs shall differ in
           one and only one feature, e.g. different formats or different
           languages, but not both.)

20180810 - Reduced max calls from 100000 to 10000

20180809 - Fixed error in fold$ function causing features being set to 0.
           The bug showed up when the output specified content type
           'noun phrases' and 'period' was only specified in the input.  

20180808 - Τοοl tips in the list of workflows.

20171125 - Skipped screen saying "Follow the status of job [##]".
           Fixed incorrect handling of input feature value with internal
		   structure, such as "txt^hq".

20170817 - Percolated unused features from the leafs (=input) to the root
           (=output). This made many tool invocations identical. This caused a
           further reduction in the number of distinct workflows. 

20170811 - Kicked out work flows that contain same tool more than once with
           same facets, only differing in subspecification of facets. But first
           it is attempted to harmonize these instances by adding
           subspecifications where necessary and possible. 

20170512 - Recognize TEI input
